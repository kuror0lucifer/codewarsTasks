// You're a square!

// A square of squares

// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

// Task

// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

// Examples

// -1  =>  false
//  0  =>  true
//  3  =>  false
//  4  =>  true
// 25  =>  true
// 26  =>  false

// Sample Tests:
// const Test = require('@codewars/test-compat');

// describe("isSquare", function(){
//   it("should work for some examples", function(){
//     Test.assertEquals(isSquare(-1), false, "-1: Negative numbers cannot be square numbers");
//     Test.assertEquals(isSquare( 0), true, "0 is a square number (0 * 0)");
//     Test.assertEquals(isSquare( 3), false, "3 is not a square number");
//     Test.assertEquals(isSquare( 4), true, "4 is a square number (2 * 2)");
//     Test.assertEquals(isSquare(25), true, "25 is a square number (5 * 5)");
//     Test.assertEquals(isSquare(26), false, "26 is not a square number");
//   });
// });

let isSquare = function (n) {
  return Math.sqrt(n) === Math.round(Math.sqrt(n));
};
