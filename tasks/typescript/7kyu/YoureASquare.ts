// You're a square!

// A square of squares
// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

// Examples
// -1  =>  false
//  0  =>  true
//  3  =>  false
//  4  =>  true
// 25  =>  true
// 26  =>  false

// Sample Tests:
// import isSquare from './solution';
// import {expect} from "chai";

// describe("solution", function() {
//   it("should work for some examples", function() {
//     expect(isSquare(-1)).to.be.false;
//     expect(isSquare( 0)).to.be.true;
//     expect(isSquare( 3)).to.be.false;
//     expect(isSquare( 4)).to.be.true;
//     expect(isSquare(25)).to.be.true;
//     expect(isSquare(26)).to.be.false;
//   });
// });

export default function isSquare(n: number): boolean {
  return Math.sqrt(n) === Math.round(Math.sqrt(n));
}
