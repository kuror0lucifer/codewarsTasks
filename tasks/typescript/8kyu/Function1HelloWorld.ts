// Function 1 - hello world

// Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

// Style Points
// Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative "hello world" you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

// Sample Tests:
// import { assert } from "chai";
// import { greet } from "./solution";

// describe("hello world", () => it("greeting", () => assert.equal(greet(), "hello world!")));

export function greet(): string {
  return "hello world!";
}
